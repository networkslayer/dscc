Welcome to the databricks Security Content Centre

This project provides access to a comprehensive collection of security content, guides, and background information aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework. It includes detection strategies, machine learning use cases, and playbooks—where available—to support threat hunting, detection, and investigation, all powered by the Databricks platform.
